#West Wind WebSurge
**Quick and easy load testing for your Web applications**

WebSurge is a Windows Utility that makes it easy to stress test Web
applications by capturing one or more URLs in Sessions and playing them back under 
load. The goal of this tool is to make it drop dead easy to capture
or create HTTP request content and test and play it back easily under load 
with simple results that are easy to understand and act on and that
let you *frequently* stress test Web applications for load 
characteristics during development, testing and in production.

In addition you can also use WebSurge for easy and reproducible individual
URL testing for REST or other Data services. WebSurge's easy request building
tools, convenient test options, plus the formatted output views make it an ideal
tool to test REST requests and data flow in REST applications. If you've used
tools like PostMan or Fiddler to test requests check out WebSurge for creating
savable and sharable sessions that you can easily test repeatably. Sessions are
stored in plain files and can easily be shared in source control, the file system, 
or via cloud storage solutions like DropBox or OneDrive.

Here's what the stress testing output looks like:

And here is a screen shot that demonstrates simple URL testing or reviewing
