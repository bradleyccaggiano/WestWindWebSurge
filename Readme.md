WebSurge is a Windows Utility that makes it easy to stress test Web
applications by capturing one or more URLs in a Session and playing them back under 
load. The goal of this tool is to make it drop dead quick and easy to capture
or create HTTP content and play it back easily under load with simple results that
let you frequently stress test Web applications for load
characteristics during development, testing and in production.

###Request Capturing
One important part for stress testing is making it easy to create URL requests
to test under load. To this effect WebSurge provides a number of ways to capture


You can capture content using the built-in capture tool, you can create
URL request manually using the built in Request editor and tester, or 
you can use the simple text file format that simply describes raw HTTP
headers to create request by hand, via code generation or by exporting
captured requests from the popular Fiddler HTTP Proxy tool.

Once a Session has been created you specify a length of a test
