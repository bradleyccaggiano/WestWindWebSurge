# West Wind WebSurge
**Quick and easy load testing for your Web applications**

WebSurge is a Windows application to easily capture and play back URL requests, either individually for easy application and service access scenarios, or under heavy load for stress testing scenarios. The tool also makes it easy to save, share and reuse URL sessions so once you've created a session you can easily start it up again on the same or a different machine. 

##### Web Stress Testing
The goal of this tool is to make it drop dead easy to capture or create HTTP request content and test and play it back easily under load. It provides simple results that are easy to understand and act on. It's so easy that you can *frequently* stress test Web applications for load  characteristics during development, testing and in production.

##### Interactive URL Testing
WebSurge is great for load testing, but it's also an excellent URL test tool for developers who need to test API, SOAP or any other type of HTTP application service. You can easily capture sessions and easily recall individual URLs for testing of endpoints. The formatted output views make it easy to visualize the resulting contact with syntax highlighted markup/text as well as a preview for HTML content. We've optimized the UI flow to make request access and tests as easy as possible.  If you've used tools like PostMan or Fiddler to for these tasks, check out WebSurge for creating savable and sharable sessions that you can easily test repeatably. Sessions are stored in plain files and can easily be shared in source control, the file system, or via cloud storage solutions like DropBox or OneDrive. And because it's just text it's easy to modify Sessions in raw form or generate them via code.

Here's what the stress testing output looks like:
