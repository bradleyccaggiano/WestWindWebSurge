LICENSE AGREEMENT

West Wind WebSurge comes in several license modes: Free Personal and Evaluation Use, Single User and Site License.

West Wind WebSurge is source open with source code available on GitHub, but it is a licensed product. A fully functional free version is available for personal and evaluation use, but commercial use requires purchase of a license.


PERSONAL AND EVALUATION LICENSE

The free personal and evaluation version is unrestricted and has all the features and functionality of the registered version, but shows occasional freeware notices in the user interface. Tampering with or removing of the notice is not allowed with the free personal evaluation license.


COMMERCIAL LICENSE 

For commercial use of West Wind Web Surge a license is required. Commercial use is considered use within any commercial, government, non-profit organization or single proprietor with income exceeding $80k.

For commercial use a single user license can be purchased which removes the freeware notices. Each licensed user must have a separate license, but a single user may use multiple copies of West Wind WebSurge on multiple machines, given that only one copy at a time is in use.

An organizational site license is available to allow any number of users running unlimited numbers of West Wind WebSurge instances within a single organization.

Any purchased license is valid for the duration of the major release that it was purchased for (ie. 1.00-1.99) and updates within the major version are always free. Upgrade pricing is available for major version upgrades and it's our policy to allow for free upgrades to the next major version within a year of purchase.

SOURCE CODE

The WebSurge source code is available on GitHub, and we allow modification of source code for internal use of WebSurge in your organization or for submitting pull requests to us. Under no circumstances are you allowed to re-package and re-distribute any part of WebSurge outside of your organization.

We encourage pull requests for feature suggestions or bug fixes to be submitted back to the WebSurge repository. Any contributors that provide meaningful enhancements, help with identifying and or fixing of bugs or by actively promoting West Wind WebSurge can qualify for a free license (at our consideration)
