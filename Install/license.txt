# License Agreement for West Wind WebSurge

West Wind WebSurge comes in several license modes: 

* **Free Personal and Evaluation**
* **Single User Commercial**
* **Site License**

West Wind WebSurge is **source open** with source code available on
GitHub, but it is a **licensed product**. A fully functional free version 
is available for personal and evaluation use, but **commercial use 
requires purchase of a license**.

### Personal and Evaluation License

The free personal and evaluation version is unrestricted and has all the 
features and functionality of the registered version, but shows occasional 
freeware notices in the user interface. Tampering with or removing of the 
notice is not allowed with the free personal evaluation license.

### Commercial License

For commercial use of West Wind Web Surge a license is required. Commercial 
use is considered use within any commercial, government, non-profit or religious
organization or a single proprietor with income exceeding $70,000.

For commercial use, a single user license can be purchased which removes 
the freeware notices. Each licensed user must have a separate license, but
a single user may use multiple copies of West Wind WebSurge on multiple
machines, given that only one copy at a time is in use.

An organizational site license is available to allow any number of users
running unlimited numbers of West Wind WebSurge instances within a 
single organization.

Any purchased license is valid for the duration of the major release that
it was purchased for (ie. 1.00-1.99). Upgrades to minor versions are always free, 
as are major version updates within one year of purchase of a license.


### Source Code

The WebSurge source code is available on GitHub, and we allow modification of 
source code for internal use of WebSurge in your organization or for submitting 
pull requests to us. Under no circumstances are you allowed to re-package and 
re-distribute any part of WebSurge outside of your organization.

We encourage pull requests for feature suggestions or bug fixes to be submitted 
back to the WebSurge repository. Any contributors that provide meaningful enhancements,
help with identifying and or fixing of bugs or by actively promoting West Wind WebSurge 
can qualify for a free license (at our discretion).
